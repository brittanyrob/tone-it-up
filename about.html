		<h3>Get to know your trainers, Karena and Katrina!</h3>
		
		<p class="main">By Abigail Baker</p>
		
		<p class="main">Karena and Katrina, founders of Tone It Up, are real life best friends and business partners. You may recognize them the pages of SELF Magazine, Vogue, In Style, and Shape, the shelves of Target or you may have seen them featured on Oprah, Ellen or Extra TV, but there are some things you may not know about these two. Karena and Katrina are putting a fresh face on health and fitness; Jane Fonda calls them the “New Faces of Fitness” and Marie Claire names them the ‘Power Duo’. Their hardcore following and influence over the globe is contagious and Karena and Katrina are well on their way to building an enterprise of products and media, branding themselves as the ‘it-girls’ of anything and everything.</p>
		
		<p class="main">When Tone It Up asked me to write their company bio, I gladly accepted to meet them at their office.  On my way I stopped at a Jamba Juice in hopes to impress them with my healthy smoothie. While ordering, I looked down and to my surprise their faces were there on the cover of Competitor Magazine. I guess it’s true that once you hear about something on its way up, it pops up everywhere. I became very excited to interview them.</p>

		<p class="main">As I walked up to their office I could hear the waves and feel the ocean breeze. It was exactly what I had imagined from watching their videos on YouTube. They reside just a block from the sand. As I walked in, the two greeted me with smiles and open arms. Katrina excused herself and said, “Oh we give hugs, thanks for coming.”</p>
		
		<p class="main">The two are charming, charismatic and have a welcoming aura. I looked around; their office is set up as a Hawaiian oasis including a cabana, surfboards hanging from the ceiling and a retro surf kitchen.  I was surrounded by Tone It Up tank tops, lunch boxes, DVDs, bikinis and seashells.  Shipments go out every day to their Tone It Up girls all around the world. Karena caught me looking at the apparel, “Do you want a tank?” She threw one to me. “Deal is, you have to wear it!” I nodded to assure her I would.</p>
		
		<p class="main">We decided to take a casual walk on the beach so I could ask them about how they met and their plans for Tone It Up.</p>

<p class="main">Walking along the beach, runners, skaters and bicyclists made their way around us. “This seems like the perfect, active place for you two.” Karena replied, “It’s our home. We wouldn’t trade it for anything.” I believed her. “Did you grow up here?”  “No, I’m from Indiana and Katrina’s from New Hampshire.” Tone It Up began when Karena and Katrina met at a gym in Southern California. It was no coincidence that they would meet. They ran into each other everywhere around town: coffee shops, the farmer’s market, running on the beach and even the grocery store. Both were in the fitness industry and had worked for five plus years prior to meeting each other.</p>

<p class="main">Karena, a triathlete and sports model, grew up active and passionate about fitness. She studied Kinesiology and found love for triathlon. “I wanted to inspire other women to become strong and independent; to help them break out of the troubles in their life.”  I asked, “Have you had a tough life?” “Let’s just say, everyone has their story. I’m an open book… I’ll write it someday. Fitness saved me.” “You need to write a book… I’d be the first to buy it!” Katrina nudged her and smiled.</p>

<img src="images/toneitupplan.jpg" alt"Tone It Up Meal Plan">

<p class="main">Katrina, a weight loss success story, picked up her first Exercise Physiology book at the age of thirteen. Graduating with her bachelor’s degree in Health Science, she had big plans for her fitness career. “I envisioned my life as it is now. I wanted to help others that struggled like me.  When I first moved to California I had no friends. How are you supposed to meet girlfriends in a new place!? When I met Karena at the gym, she thought I was a weird trainer trying to talk to her. It took her some warming up to hang out with me… or to return my calls.”</p>

<p class="main">“Actually it took finding me at Trader Joes and forcing me to take one of your classes!” Karena said under her breath. The girls laughed and said they hit it off right away with their personalities and shared values. “What’s cool, is girls are meeting through Tone It Up all over the globe, becoming best friends like we have.  That’s something we didn’t expect, but are so amazed by!  This community is the most incredible group of inspiring women. Whenever we meet a Tone It Up member, it’s like seeing a longtime girlfriend.”</p>

<p class="main">Within a year they opened their first fitness studio together and taught beach boot-camps.  They have since outgrown their fitness studio into their new offices, but say they may revisit opening a studio again someday.  ”Having a fitness studio was a lot of fun for us. It was a small 400 square foot space, full of energy and love. We’ll always have a place for it in our hearts!”</p>

<p class="main">“What is it that you two do?  What is everyday like for you?”</p>

<p class="main">“We easily ‘work’ over 100 hours a week… we live and breathe Tone It Up. It’s our life. We wake up to thousands of women checking in with their workouts, posting recipes they love, inspiring other Tone It Up Team members with their stories or writing their own Tone It Up blog in the community. We send out emails with challenges and film workout videos on the beach. We’re also really active with our community.”</p>

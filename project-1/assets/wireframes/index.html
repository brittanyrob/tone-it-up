		<h3>New Tone It Up Show On Bravo!</h3></p>			
				<p class="main">To our Tone It Up Community,

Something really exciting is happening.  We realize that every week it seems we have a big surprise, announcement, event or a new product launch… and it’s true!!!  All of our hard work over the past 4.5 years is finally catching up and we are so grateful that you embrace everything as your own, because it’s all for you!<p>

<p class="main">When we first launched Tone It Up, in March 2009, we wanted to create a place where women could find fun workouts, delicious, healthy recipes and support one another in each other’s goals and aspirations. It has far exceeded our expectations, and we feel so blessed to have such a positive, supportive and beautiful community.  It’s a movement of women really reaching their goals~ together!!</p>

<h3>Are you ready for the news!?!</h3>

<p class="main">We’ve been working really hard on something, and we’ve never been so thrilled. We are going to show you  all of our Behind the Scenes footage, how everything comes together, bring you into the Tone It Up office, on set of our workout videos and into our home, as best friends and business partners!! AND it’s going to air on Bravo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  You will really get to know us, as friends and how we live our lives everyday.  Our show is called ‘Toned Up’… How fitting?! :) A lot of you have seen press releases in the past that we were going to work with them, and it has finally happened!!! We can’t believe it!  We’re still sitting here saying “Who us?”</p>

<p class="main">Bravo wanted to not only capture behind the scenes of how Tone It Up comes together, our DVD production, Perfect Fit Protein and how we independently produce all of our videos and products, but they also wanted to capture us; two women who are best friends, who work together, support each other, and run a business together.  What we love about this show…  you really get to see us hustle each day… the challenges we face, the creative side of each project and how we make our dreams come true, together!</p>
